## Description
This is a an API for a Social Media App. It was designed to allow the user to share their thoughts to each other. If something someone says bugs you you can react to their thought, or just unfriend them completely! You've got that kind of freedom with this app. There is no front end for this app, as it is a backend application.
check out me using it at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FC8VTRiB9EhtEFqtcxLSh772xLnEuO9e/view I promise I'm not nervous.
